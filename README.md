## 🔄 Application Flow

1. **`form.jsp`**  
   - Displays an input form where users can enter their data.

2. **`insert.jsp`**  
   - Retrieves submitted data from the request.
   - Populates a `FormVo` (Value Object). vo 객체에 값을 채워넣음
   - Uses `FormDao` (Data Access Object) to insert the data into the Oracle database. FormDao 사용해서 진짜 db에 넣는 작업.
   - Forwards the request to `result.jsp`.

3. **`result.jsp`**  
   - Displays the data that was just inserted into the database.

4. **`FormVo.java`**
   - A simple Java class that holds the data fields with getters and setters.

5. **`FormDao.java`**
   - Handles database operations like `insert()` and `select()` using JDBC.
   - Establishes a connection to the Oracle database.

## ⚙️ Features

- Accepts user input through a web form.
- Connects to Oracle DB and performs insert operations via JDBC.
- Displays the submitted data as confirmation.
- Demonstrates MVC-like separation using DAO and VO patterns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository into your Eclipse workspace.
2. Set up your Oracle database and update connection details in `FormDao.java`.
3. Deploy the project on Apache Tomcat.
4. Access `form.jsp` via your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/HelloWeb2/GroupProject/form.jsp`).
5. Fill out the form, submit it, and check the result page.

## 📌 Notes

- This project is designed for learning basic web application structure with JSP and JDBC.
- For production-level code, using a proper MVC framework like Spring MVC is recommended.
